<p>If paying by debit card, or credit card, you give us permission to automatically charge your credit or debit card as payment for your Program, Product or Service without any additional authorization, for which you will receive an electronic receipt.</span></span></span></p>

<p>In the event that payment is not received by the date due, you will have a three (3) day grace period to make the payment otherwise the Program, Product or Services will not continue and we reserve the right to cease your access immediately and permanently.</span></span></span></p>

<p>You agree to only purchase goods or services for yourself or for another person for whom you are legally permitted to do so or for whom you have obtained the express consent to provide their name, address, method of payment, credit card number, and billing information.</span></span></span></p>

You agree that we shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, refunds, or other matters of any sort that incurred as the result of such dealings with a Merchant.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Payment processing companies and Merchants may have privacy and data collection practices that are different from ours. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies of the payment processing companies and Merchants. In addition, when you make certain purchases through our Programs, Products or Services, you may be subject to the additional terms and conditions of a payment processing company, Merchant or us that specifically apply to your purchase. For more information regarding a Merchant and its terms and conditions that may apply, visit that merchant&rsquo;s Website and click on its information links or contact the Merchant directly.</span></span></span></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:18pt"><strong>REFUND POLICY​</strong></span></span></span></h2>

<p>All sales are final on coaching or consulting services or digital product purchases. If you purchase a physical product and are not satisfied with the product you may return it in resell-able condition within 30 calendar days from your order for a refund less a restocking fee of $50. After 30 days, no refunds will be granted but you may apply the balance (minus shipping and $50 admin fee) as a credit toward a future product, event or service in the next 12 months from the date of purchase.</span></span></span></p>

<p>PAYMENT OPTIONS: A payment option may be offered to you as a courtesy. You are responsible for making all payments in your agreement of purchase whether you complete the program or not.

<p>We reserve the right in our sole discretion to refuse or terminate your access to our Programs, Products, Services or Program Materials, in full or in part, at any time, without notice, by sending you an e-mail to the e-mail address you provided upon purchase of the Program, Product or Service.</span></span></span></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:18pt"><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></span></span></span></h2>

<p>It is hoped that should we ever have any differences; we could be able to work them out amicably through e-mail correspondence. However, should we be unable to seek resolution within a reasonable time, you agree now that that the only method of legal dispute resolution that will be used is binding arbitration before a single arbitrator, selected jointly, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association Rules. Prior to seeking arbitration, you must send an e-mail to us at info@JolianeTremblay.com and include all of your reasons for dissatisfaction with your Program. You understand and agree now that the only remedy that can be awarded to you through arbitration is full refund of your Payment made to date. No other actions or financial awards of consequential damages, or any other type of damages, may be granted to you. We both agree now that the decision of the arbitrator is final and binding, and may be entered as a judgment into any court having the appropriate jurisdiction.</span></span></span></p>

<p>By purchasing our Programs, Products or Services you are agreeing to a modification of the statute of limitations such that any arbitration must begin within one (1) year of the date of your e-mail to me referenced above or you waive the right to seek dispute resolution by arbitration or to take any other legal action.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>You also agree that should arbitration take place, it will be held in Delaware, and the prevailing party shall be entitled to all reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and all costs necessary to enforce the decision of the arbitrator.</span></span></span></p>

<p>In the event of a dispute between us, you agree to not engage in any conduct or communications, public or private, including on social media, designed to disparage us, our Company, or any of our Programs, Products or Services. Where requested by law or arbitration, of course, you are not prohibited from sharing your thoughts and opinions as a part of the legal process.</span></span></span></p>

<p>If any terms of these Terms of Use are construed to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other term which shall be given full force and effect.</span></span></span></p>
